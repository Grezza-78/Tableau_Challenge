# Tableau_Challenge - Citi Bike Analysis

As the lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, I have been tasked to taken on the analysis of the program by implementing a comprehensive dashboard and advanced reporting process to share information with City officials who have inquiries about the program. By leveraging creating insightful reports, I hope to contribute to the program's growth and success, and assist city officials in making informed decisions, improving the program, and further promoting its benefits to the public.

## The Challenge

* 1 : Design 2–5 visualisations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you can also merge multiple datasets from different periods.
* 2 : Use visualisations to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards should be accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring.
* 3 : Create a dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.
* 4 : Create a final presentation using a Tableau Story
