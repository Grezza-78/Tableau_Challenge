# Tableau_Challenge - Citi Bike Analysis

As the lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, I have been tasked to taken on the analysis of the program by implementing a comprehensive dashboard and advanced reporting process to share information with City officials who have inquiries about the program. By leveraging creating insightful reports, I hope to contribute to the program's growth and success, and assist city officials in making informed decisions, improving the program, and further promoting its benefits to the public.

## The Challenge

* 1 : Design 2–5 visualisations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you can also merge multiple datasets from different periods.
* 2 : Use visualisations to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards should be accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring.
* 3 : Create a dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.
* 4 : Create a final presentation using a Tableau Story

## Data Source 

* 1 : The initial stage of the project involved acquiring all the monthly CSV files, covering the period from June 2022 to May 2023, from the Citi Bike Data webpage and organizing them in a designated folder named "data". The data used in this analysis specifically pertains to the Jersey City region.
* 2 : I created a Jupyter Notebook file, named "CitiBike_data_merge.ipynb", to systematically clean and combine all the monthly CSV files into a single CSV file, in preparation for importing into Tableau. 

**Please note that the large size of the CSV files precludes their storage in this repository**

## Dashboards 

* 1 : **Homepage** is an introductory hub for the project, offering a brief and clear overview of its purpose and contents. It provides a concise summary of the main insights and findings from each dashboard, enabling seamless and efficient navigation for users.

* 2 : **User Analysis** offers a thorough analysis of Citi Bike trips, encompassing multiple factors like user type and bike usage. It provides a detailed exploration of trip patterns based on the hour of the day and day of the week, along with the total number of trips per month and average trip time. This comprehensive analysis sheds light on various aspects of Citi Bike usage, enabling a deeper understanding of the data.

* 3 : **Station Analysis** emphasizes the analysis of trips concerning the bike stations. It compares the patterns of trips between weekdays and weekends, and between stations, offering valuable insights into the variations in usage.

* 4 : **Map Analysis** showcases two dynamics maps that highlight the geographic locations of both the start and end stations. The markers on the maps are sized and colored based on the total number of trips originating from or terminating at each station. This visual representation effectively illustrates the trip patterns and frequency, enabling a clear understanding of the data at a glance.
